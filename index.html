            <p>Hello everyone!</p>
            <p>My name is Erandy Ramirez I enjoy exercising, lifting weights,
                swimming, and running. I recently moved and live in a different 
                state from where I grew up in Mexico, and I'm very happy. 
                I'm very excited and looking forward to this semester.</p>

            <p>Mexico is a country with many beatiful places, people, and amazing food.
                People in Mexico are very warm and kind, they worry about others, and family is very important here.
                We have many important traditions and festivities, we honor our culture and values by living those traditions.
